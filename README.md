## Development

Password encryption (system login) was implemented using 3 security packages: werkzeug, passlib and cryptography. These packages offer libraries that support encryption by means of different algorithms, such as SHA-256. Once this stage is passed, the system executes the implementation of the enigma machine, configuring the 3 rotors, the main carnation, and the basic aspects of its operation. Last but not least, it starts the user flow so that the console can use the functions described above.

## Difficulties

In general, this was a project that did not generate major problems, since the security libraries have a good documentation of their functionalities. However, configuring the enigma machine represented a real challenge, since its rotors are highly complex. In addition, its connection with the internal and external configurations, as a student and as an engineer, I had to have a great concentration in the analyzed area.

## Conclusions

Security is an issue of great importance nowadays, as many systems use encrypted keys or codes to hide important information. In this way, understanding the algorithm of an enigma machine allows us to know our history as humanity, our history as engineers, and at the same time makes us understand what awaits us in the future. I personally consider enigma to be a great basis for everything that exists at this moment, and the same people who created it or deciphered it (Alan Turing), have left a great legacy in humanity.
